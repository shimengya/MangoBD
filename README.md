MongoDB, or Mongo, is a document database that offers far more flexibility than a structured database like SQL when it comes to storing data. It's able to handle smaller, more personal projects as well as larger-scale projects that a company might require. 

MongoDB has a unique structure that is advantageous for working with unstructured data, as well as for storing multiple related datasets.
